Compute, Storage and Network

Compute
    Virtual Machines
    App Service - web and mobile app (PaaS)
    Container Instances
    Azure Kubernetes Service
    Azure Functions - similar to app service but just runs a specific function and shuts down later

Storage
    Blob - unstructured data without hierarchy (images, videos, large files)
        hot
        cool
        archive
    file Storage - hierarchy
        can be mounted on servers
    data lake
        for data analytics
    SQL Database
    DB for opensource
        SQL, 
    Synapse Analytics
    Cosmos DB - noSQL db
    Redis Cache - noSQL cache

Network
    VNet 
        - connecting a group of virtual machines under a virtual network
        - each VM has a IP address
        - default, from VM to public internet is allowed
        - to enable inbound traffic from internet to VM, public IP should be assigned to the VM
        - VNet can also be divided into subnets
    VNet Peering
        - VM can communicate with other VMs within the same VNET
        - to communicate between VMs in different VNets, VNet peering can be done
    Azure VPN
        - to communicate between VM and an on-premise datacenter using public internet
        - data is encrypted
    Azure ExpressRoute
        - to communicate between azure VM and an on-premise datacenter using private dedicated connection
        - expensive but reliable and fast
